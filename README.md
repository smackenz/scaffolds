## Intro
It's just a little 'Baukasten' or Boilerplate for your next Craft CMS or Prototyping Project. WordPress is also on Board
but has not the priority as the other ones. Most of the stuff fits for my own requirements and maybe you have the same
you can have a lot of fun with it. Give it a try.

## IMPORTANT NOTE
Actually the WordPress Version has no Focus. Craft CMS + Prototyping have priority! But you can use it, no problem.

Big thanks to [Sascha Fuchs](https://github.com/gisu) and his [Kittn](http://kittn.de/) for a lot of help and inspiration.
Also big thanks to [Martin Herweg](https://github.com/martinherweg) and his [YO Generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-mh-boilerplate) that help me a lot too.
