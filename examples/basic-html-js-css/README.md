# bp-html-sass-assets
Generates basic html setup but implements sass, html5 boilerplate, html include, and assets copying.

This is meant to be the simplest of simple setups for anyone needing a classic frontend setup, but still
wants to use sass and a build setup that's expandable

    Clone repo
    Run 'npm-install' or 'yarn'
    Run 'gulp'
    Extend build setup at will with bower, react, jQuery, whatevs.js
